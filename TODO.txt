[ ] consider https://github.com/laravel/socialite over facebook-sdk
[ ] pivot to Austin project: admin panel, plupload lib
  ~ NO this wont' work: because for multiple files there are multiple calls -- instead of 2 api calls, do one, and send the other form data in the plupload post
   => clssfy architecture is correct one
[ ] ?? Should Auth/AuthController et. al be in src or be installed under build via script??
[ ] refactor login/registration partials
[ ] in auth partials, use Laravel helpers
[ ] add FB login (later)
[ ] Form builder (!)
[ ] Ajax/api driven page

[ ] https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/authorization vs entrust

%%%
[ ] Build out the Austin site with this

[ ] Add constraints to Entrust tables (see migration)
[ ] Add CreatePasswordResetsTable (see migrations)
[ ] updating of providers and aliases (may have to do this manually for now)
