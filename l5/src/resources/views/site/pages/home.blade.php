        <h3>How my Career Began</h3>
        <p>
        My first experience coding was in the mid-80s, when a friend would come over after school and we'd boot-up my Commodore-64, attach it to the TV, and code away together in BASIC. Our first working program was a text-based 'football' simulator, where you could choose between running and passing places, and yardage was randomly selected. The challenge and fun of conceiving an idea, and figuring out how to evolve it into working software immediately hooked me on programming.
        </p>
        <p>A few years later in college at Wesleyan University, while helping my physics professor setup his new lab, I taught myself UNIX and C to write programs to analyze experiment data. After graduate school I was hired by Silicon Graphics, where I was able to apply not only my C coding skills, but learned to work with a large team of engineers to design &amp; build sophisticated graphics processing chips.
